It turns out that in text classification there are often features that are not particularly useful predictors for the document class, either because they are too common or too uncommon.  **Stop-words** are extremely common, low-information words like \"a\", \"the\", \"as\", etc.  Removing these from documents is typically the first thing done in peparing data for document classification. \n"
