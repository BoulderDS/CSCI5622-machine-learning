### Course Description 

Machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that learn from experience. Machine learning systems have been developed and used in a wide range of settings, ranging from spam detection, to medical diagonosis, to recommendation systems that adapts to and even defines our preferences, to autonomous vehicles that learn to drive. There have also been important advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. This course will provide a broad introduction to the field of machine learning.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to take a problem and analyze it to determine which machine learning techniques are appropriate for solving the problem, how to prepare data to use that solution, apply the solution, and to evaluate the results. For the most common machine learning techniques, you’ll also be able to implement solutions in Python.

It is required that you have regular access to a computer and an Internet connection throughout this course. A laptop is preferable.


### Textbook 

The main textbook for the course will be [A Course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info/) by [Hal Daumé III](http://hal3.name/). 

### Course Web Page 

All information about this course will be hosted on the github repo: [https://github.com/BoulderDS/CSCI5622-machine-learning](https://github.com/BoulderDS/CSCI5622-machine-learning).

All discussions will happen on Piazza: [https://piazza.com/class/jza7ib732nu1yz](https://piazza.com/colorado/fall2018/csci4622).
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the grader, and the instructor. **Rather than emailing me questions, I request that you to post your questions on Piazza**.  If your question is of a private nature, Piazza allows you to send me a private message. It is your responsibility to check the web page on a regular basis. Here you will find detailed information such as news, homework assignments and solutions, and instructor office hours. 

### Computing

A major component of this course is to learn modern, practical computing skills for machine learning.  Our two main tools will be Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks.  It is estimated that around 50% of practicing data scientists do most of their analysis using Python (while the other roughly 50% use R, which we shall not speak of).  The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based programming environment that allows you to seamlessly mix Python code (as well as many other languages), graphics, and exposition (in Markdown).  The Jupyter Notebook has become ubiquitous in the data science community for rapidly prototyping ideas and sharing them with colleagues and the rest of the world. 

It is strongly recommended that you install Python 3 and Jupyter on your local machine. By far, the easiest way to do this is by installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python 3.7.  This distribution comes with many Python packages useful for data science and scientific computation in general. It also comes with Jupyter by default.

Frequently in class we will explore computational problems directly in Jupyter notebooks.  It is highly recommended that you bring a laptop with you to class, however it's perfectly acceptable that you team up with a classmate on a single computer. 

### Coursework 

**Homework**: Homework will be assigned roughly every two weeks in the first 13 weeks and due by 11:59 PM on Fridays on Moodle.  Assignments will be a mix of theoretical and computational problems.  The theoretical problems may include by-hand computations and simple proofs.  The computational problems will involve implementing and analyzing your own predictive models in Python or using canned routines from Scikit-Learn.  All assignments will be completed and submitted in Jupyter Notebooks. 
**We do not allow any late submissions, but your lowest homework score will be dropped**.
As a result, if you are only late once, it will not have any impact on your final grades.
You are expected to write up your solutions neatly, with full explanations and justifications. You may discuss problems with your classmates, **but all work must be your own**.  See the **Collaboration Policy** below for more details. 



**Exams**: Two in-class prelims will happen throughout the semester to allow for quick evaluation and feedback of your learning progress.

**Final project**: You will work on a final project in groups of three to four students. We will offer choices of projects. You can also propose projects to the instructor.

### Grade Determination 

The overall grades will be based on a cumulative score computed from 

* Homework (35% of the grade);
* Exams (30% of the grade, two times);
* Final project (30% of the grade);
* Participation (5% of the grade, based on in-class participation and Piazza activities);


Unless adjustments are necessary, letter grades will be assigned using the standard grading scale: 

| Letter | Raw Average |
|--------|-------------|
|     A  |   93-100    |
|     A- |   90-92     |
|     B+ |   87-89     |
|     B  |   83-86     |
|     B- |   80-82     |
|     C+ |   77-79     |
|     C  |   73-76     |
|     C- |   70-72     |
|     D+ |   67-69     |
|     D  |   63-66     |
|     D- |   60-62     |
|     F  |   00-59     |

### Collaboration Policy 

The collaboration policy is simple:

* **Inspiration is free**: you may discuss homework assignments with anyone. You are especially encouraged to discuss solutions with your instructor and your classmates.

* **Plagiarism is forbidden**: the assignments **and code** that you turn in should be written entirely on your own. You should not need to consult sources beyond your textbook, class notes, posted lecture slides and notebooks, Python/Scikit-Learn/Numpy documentation, and online sources for _basic_ techniques. Copying/soliciting a solution to a problem from the internet or another classmate constitutes a violation of the course's collaboration policy and the honor code and will result in an **F** in the course and a trip to the honor council.

* **Do not search for a solution on-line**: You may not actively search for a solution to the problem from the internet. This includes posting to sources like StackExchange, Reddit, Chegg, etc. 

* **StackExchange Clarification**: Searching for basic techniques in Python/Pandas/Numpy is totally fine.  If you want to post and ask "How do I group by two columns, then do something, then group by a third column" that's fine.  What you **cannot** do is post "Here's the DataFrame my prof gave me.  I need to convert **Age** in Earth years to Martian years and then predict the person's favorite color.  **Give me code!**".  That's cheating, yo. 

* **When in doubt, ask**: If you have doubts about this policy or would like to discuss specific cases, please ask the instructor.
